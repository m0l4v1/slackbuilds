wine-compat32: WINE (Wine Is Not an Emulator -- 32bit)
wine-compat32:
wine-compat32: Wine is an Open Source implementation of the Windows API on top of
wine-compat32: X and Unix; it is a compatibility layer for running Windows programs.
wine-compat32: Wine does not require Microsoft Windows, as it is a completely free
wine-compat32: alternative implementation of the Windows API. However, Wine can
wine-compat32: optionally use native Windows DLLs if they are available. Wine
wine-compat32: provides both a development toolkit for porting Windows source code
wine-compat32: to Unix, as well as a program loader to run Windows applications.
